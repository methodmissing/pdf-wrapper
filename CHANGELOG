v0.1.5 (Unreleased)

    should continue at the top of the next page, not the y value the
    text started at

- Wrapper#font_size now accepts a block for temporary font size changes
- Allow the page size to be changed when starting a new page

- Deprecated Table#table_options in favour of passing options to Table#new
  - Thanks to Zubin Henner for the suggestion

  that can be used to specify both the content and options of the header row.
  - Thanks to Zubin Henner for the suggestion
